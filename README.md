We have created this repository to provide farmers with an easy-to-use online platform that can help you optimize your farming practices and increase your yields.

Krishi Vriksha is a comprehensive online resource that provides farmers with access to a vast library of information on various crops, soil management, pest control, and other agricultural topics. Our team of experts has compiled this information to help farmers make informed decisions for their farms and improve their overall agricultural practices.

In this repository, you will find our website's source code and a comprehensive user manual to help you navigate our platform. The user manual contains step-by-step instructions on how to access and use the various features of Krishi Vriksha. We have also included a detailed documentation file to assist developers in understanding the project's structure and implementation details.

We encourage developers to contribute to our project by submitting bug reports, feature requests, and code improvements. You can do this by submitting a pull request or by contacting our development team through our website's contact page.

We hope that Krishi Vriksha will be a valuable tool for your farming operations. If you have any questions or feedback, please do not hesitate to contact us. Thank you for choosing Krishi Vriksha
